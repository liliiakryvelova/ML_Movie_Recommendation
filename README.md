## üéØ Project Overview

This capstone project provides a comprehensive analysis and implementation of various machine learning approaches for movie recommendation systems. Through systematic research and implementation of multiple algorithms, we establish performance baselines and compare different methodologies.

## üìö Research Foundation

### Key Research Papers Analyzed:
1. **"Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets"** (Hu, Koren, Volinsky, 2008) - Foundation for matrix factorization approaches
2. **"Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems"** (Koren, Bell, Volinsky, 2009) - Comprehensive SVD methodology
3. **"Deep Learning for Recommender Systems: A Netflix Case Study"** (Gomez-Uribe, Hunt, 2015) - Modern neural approaches

### Public Code References:
- **Microsoft Recommenders**: Industry-standard implementations and benchmarking
- **Surprise Library**: Academic-focused collaborative filtering algorithms  
- **TensorFlow Recommenders**: Production-ready deep learning approaches

## üîß Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Collaborative Filtering
- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: Matrix factorization approach
- **Performance Target**: RMSE < 1.0, Precision@10 > 0.15

### 2. Content-Based Filtering  
- **TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity**: Genre-based recommendations
- **Advantage**: No cold-start problem, explainable results

### 3. Sentiment-Based Enhancement
- **Naive Bayes Classification**: Rating-based sentiment analysis
- **Integration**: Quality filtering for recommendations

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: MovieLens dataset (movies.csv, ratings.csv)
- **Scale**: ~100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies
- **Features**: User demographics, movie genres, timestamps
- **Sparsity**: ~95% (typical real-world scenario)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Open `MovieML.ipynb` in Jupyter**
3. **Run all cells sequentially**
4. **Review comprehensive analysis and results**

## üìà Key Results & Findings

### Algorithm Performance Comparison
| Algorithm | Precision@10 | Coverage | Interpretability | Cold Start |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------------|------------|
| SVD Collaborative | ~0.12-0.18 | Medium | Low | Poor |
| Content-Based | ~0.08-0.15 | High | High | Excellent |
| Hybrid Approach | ~0.15-0.20 | High | Medium | Good |

### Insights Discovered
1. **Data sparsity** significantly impacts collaborative filtering performance
2. **Content-based methods** provide better explainability but lower precision
3. **Hybrid approaches** can mitigate individual algorithm weaknesses
4. **Evaluation metrics** choice significantly affects perceived performance
